Innovation:
- Weighted A* search as opposed to ‘uniform’ A* search learnt in class
- Implemented different heuristics (Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, and Diagonal distance) so that each one’s performance can be compared
- Built A* search that uses a heap of nodes for the open-set for simpler insertion and removal of (neighbouring) nodes
